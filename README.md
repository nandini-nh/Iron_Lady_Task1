## Understanding Iron Lady as a Business

Before starting this task, I explored the Iron Lady website to understand its business model,
program offerings, and target audience.

Iron Lady focuses on empowering women through skill-based programs, leadership training,
and career readiness initiatives. Many users visiting the platform require clarity about
programs and the application process before enrolling.

---

## Problem Statement

Users often have multiple questions related to:
- Available programs
- Eligibility criteria
- Application process

Handling these queries manually can increase response time and reduce user engagement.

---

## Solution Overview

An AI-based Program Assistant was designed to act as a virtual support system.
The assistant provides instant, conversational guidance to users and helps them
understand Iron Lady’s programs and processes.

---

## How the Solution Works

- Users interact with the assistant through a chat interface
- Users can ask questions such as:
  - What programs are available?
  - What is the application process?
- The AI generates relevant responses in real time

---

## AI Usage and Busy Handling

AI is used to understand user intent and generate meaningful responses.

In scenarios where the AI service is temporarily unavailable due to rate limits or
high traffic, the application gracefully displays a clear “busy” message instead
of crashing. This ensures reliability and a smooth user experience.

---

## Business Value

- Improves customer experience and engagement
- Reduces dependency on manual support
- Builds trust through instant and reliable assistance

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java (Servlets)
- AI Integration: External AI service (demo environment)
- Server: Apache Tomcat

---

## Conclusion

This solution demonstrates how AI can enhance Iron Lady’s customer support journey
while handling real-world AI limitations in a professional manner.
